        <br>
            <p>Prince Georges County has had a repeated issue with traffic violations such as speeding 
                and accidents. Many drivers are not aware why cameras are put into specific areas.
                Due to the lack of knowelege and precautions taken towards this issue, we have created this 
                website to educate the public. The public needs to be aware of areas with 
                speed cameras which will push for safer driving and will help prevent needless accidents.</p>
